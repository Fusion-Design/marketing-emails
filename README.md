# Foundation for Emails & MailChimp

## Summary

Built using [Foundation for Emails](http://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails/). The idea behind this repository is to have a centralized version of our marketing emails easily accessible for use either directly or via third party services. Using F4Email setup this is made up of the following:

- **Partials** - Individual reusable components of all layouts
- **Layouts** - These are the core designs
- **Pages** - Individual variations on the overall layouts which are ultimately imported into a service provider.

## Using MailChimp?

Run the following command instead to export any editable rules in `src/mailchimp/editable.css` to the `/dist` source file:

```bash
npm run mailchimp
```

Using MailChimp it is a good idea when setting up new email templates to make use of their templating language to make templates more editable using their interfaces. E.g:
```html
<p mc:edit="body"></p>
```

For more information and details see the MailChimp [Templating Language Guide](http://templates.mailchimp.com/getting-started/template-language/) and [Merge Tags Guide](http://templates.mailchimp.com/getting-started/merge-tags/basic-merge-tags/).
